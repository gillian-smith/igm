    Compute the vertically-averaged Arrhenius factor for ice flow.

    Calculates the 3D Arrhenius factor A scaled by an enhancement factor, then performs
    vertical averaging over B = A^(-1/n) (related to viscosity) rather than over A directly.
    The final result is converted back: A_avg = (Σ B_i * w_i)^(-n).

    This approach is physically motivated since B is proportional to viscosity,
    and averaging viscosity is more appropriate than averaging the rate factor.

    Updates state.arrhenius (MPa^-n yr^-1).
